mkdir adoreventure-showcase
cd adoreventure-showcase

# Copy safe files
cp README.md .
cp LICENSE .
cp .gitignore .
cp -r showcase/ .
cp PORTFOLIO_CASE_STUDY.md .
cp TECHNICAL_HIGHLIGHTS.md .

# Initialize public repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - AdoreVenture showcase"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/adoreventure.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Repository Settings**
